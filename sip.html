                        With our human labor and access to the internet, we can create advertising services that promote Talikalas' advocacy. This solution is sustainable for Talikala because these websites and posts will remain on the internet forever. Using our knowledge and skills in online and economics, we can turn this idea into something sustainable for us while also benefiting Talikala because our project helps with their issues with the lack of resources and funding.
