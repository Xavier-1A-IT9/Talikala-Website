	<p id = "csu">Talikala is a non-stock and non-profit social development organization that offers support, advice, training, and counseling to women and girls forced into the sex trade in Davao City. The organization's mission is to help these exploited women establish new lives after prostitution. Talikala, Inc. counts as part of its primary successes the self-help organizations of women in prostitution that began in 1993 with Lawig Bubai in Davao City. The services it provides are education and awareness-raising on topics revolving around sexuality, human rights, and anti-sexualizing, referral of cases, medical, food, and transportation, and technical assistance of Lawig Bubai, Advocacy, and Networking.

	<p id = "csu">Talikala Inc, its mission, activities, and programs rely on funds from their sponsors or benefactors. As many cases of prostitution arise, Talikala is one of the institutions that aid this problem or respond to its effects. However, many non-profit organizations that lack funds are forced to cut down their operations and make budget cuts. This could be a major problem for them. As we dive into our group’s project proposal, you will see how Talikala can benefit from our project proposal since they will be able to assist and support women who have been victims of sexual exploitation, prostitution, and other types of abuse.

        <p id = "csu">To address the issue of lack of resources, we will cater to their unmet needs by providing our advertising services to them. We can develop websites that will educate and enlighten visitors about Talikala's cause. We’re also able to inform people about our partner institution on social media platforms like Facebook. If we do this, we are making people aware of Talikala's struggles, which leads to increased attention and help from everyone. It is hoped that many people would choose to support our partner organization, whether it is by donations, volunteer work, or spreading the word about Talikala to persuade others to lend a hand. By doing this, we may further raise awareness of our partner institution, Talikala.

            This project will promote Talikalas main concern which is helping exploited women by making Talikala much more known throughout Davao through the use of promotional materials like websites and posts online making it easier for them to help exploited women reach out to Talikala. 
            <br><br>These advertising materials will also help Talikala because they’ll likely get more sponsors, donations, and volunteers which will allow Talikala to expand their initiatives and missions because they have more resources to do so.

            Such a solution is excellent long-term and sustainable for Talikala because these websites and posts will always be accessible online, people can use them to learn more about Talikala, and if it works, Talikala will benefit since people will be able to assist and support women who have been the victims of sexual exploitation, prostitution, and other types of abuse. Through our proposal, Talikala could find sponsors or donors who are willing to make large contributions to support their advocacy. The alternative scenario is that people learn about it and inform their friends. Even though it might not be much, their friends could be willing to sponsor them, and over time, small donations from many people will add up. If not, their acquaintances might also be aware of a wealthy person who is eager to lend a hand. If they’re unable to donate to Talikala, maybe they could volunteer instead. There are a lot of victims of prostitution, so more manpower is always helpful.

        <p id = "backgroundtext">
            Talikala's ability to expand operations and improve the services they provide to women is hampered by a lack of funds and resources. To operate its activities, projects, advocacies, and campaigns, this institution needs sufficient funds and sponsorship. Especially since they are handling many victims, being able to provide them with their needs such as counseling, food, shelter, clothes, protection, education, etc is important. Talikala's inability to obtain adequate funds and resources not only impedes its current operations but also prevents them from progressing and developing.

Since these websites or articles will always be accessible to people online, our advertising strategy is far better than alternatives like providing them with money or goods. Giving them stuff or money has the drawback of being a temporary fix. We are not wealthy, and even if we are Atenean students, there's only so much we can give. We don't have jobs or other sources of income, therefore, the money and commodities will eventually run out and we won't be able to contribute much. But let's imagine that we did go with the other solution. Everyone in our group agrees to give Talikala a donation of 100 pesos each. Since there are five of us, the total we will be donating is 500 pesos. Given that Talikala has more than 1400 members, the 500 pesos we donate will be gone in a single day. This will most likely be a one-time donation because we aren't wealthy. In other words, our financial support won't be much. This is why our advertising strategy is far better than that one because if people learn about their advocacy and decide to band together and support them, Talikala's lack of resources won't be as much of a problem.

            Since grade school, Ateneans have been trained to respond to problems that their institutions face except now at the junior high school unit. We have to address them in a way that we project our values as students of the Ateneo de Davao University and as a long-term solution. We gain experience on how to solve problems and formulate solutions. This project also trains us to exert Magis and cura personalis, two of the values that Ateneans possess and are being shaped into and enables us to use the skills and knowledge we have gathered in the past years and quarters. We initially decided to pursue a website In the process of creating our website, gathering involves learning how to differentiate facts from assumptions, knowing how to consolidate data acquired from the sources, and personifying patience, perseverance, and insistence. To do your best (Magis) in gathering data from sources, interviews, emails, and such are a representation of how Ateneans value Magis at heart, making sure that whatever they do, it follows excellent, on-point, and valid work. In data gathering, we verify our information if it’s accurate or not which reflects the value of honesty–another characteristic we Ateneans possess.The values we are taught and used to having are still embodied in data gathering as the Ateneans that we are.        </p>

            The resources we need for our proposal are manpower. This consists of people who are willing to put in hard work to set up web pages on the institution, give out influence on social media platforms, and continuously promote the cause of the partnered institution. We have the skills to code web pages for the institution so we don’t need to worry about spending money on hiring people to do these things. We also need technology such as our gadgets and the internet in order to create websites/posters, post on social media, etc. We don’t need to spend money on buying these gadgets or paying for the internet since we already have these things at home and in school.         </p>

            This project is important for the general public since it raises awareness of Talikala, an organization whose mission is to assist exploited women in establishing new lives after prostitution. Talikala needs both financial and labor support, which is why we must let people know about it. Our mission is to inform the public about the causes of prostitution among women and children, how Talikala assists these women, the problems the institution is currently dealing with, and how you can lend a hand. Raising awareness involves educating and informing people about a topic or issue with the intention of influencing their attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs in the direction of achieving a particular objective or goal. We want individuals to take action and find solutions to problems like prostitution—or at the very least, support efforts to do so—we want people to care more about topics like these. If they read our website, they will be motivated to help Talikala reach their objectives by volunteering or making a donation.
